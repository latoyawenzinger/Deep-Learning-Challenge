# Deep-Learning-Challenge

A machine learning tool was created for a nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup, to determine if future applicants will be successful if funded. 

## **Overview**:

The purpose of this analysis is to take a look at the performance of the deep learning model that was created. It will explain the thought process behind data processing, training, and optimizing techninques used to enhance the model. 

## **Results**

### **Data Preprocessing**:

* Target Variable: 
  * 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' - was the money used successfully (0 or 1)
* Feature Variables: 
  * AFFILIATION — Affiliated sector of industry
  * CLASSIFICATION — Government organization classification
  * USE_CASE — Use case for funding
  * ORGANIZATION — Organization type
  * STATUS — Active status
  * INCOME_AMT — Income classification
  * SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS — Special considerations for application
  * ASK_AMT — Funding amount requested
  
* Removed Data:
 * EIN and NAME — Identification columns


## **Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**:

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
